"""Run pipeline stages in-process under per-run ``MC_CITY_*`` overrides.

Configuration model and its invariant
--------------------------------------
The config modules (``config.algo``, ``config.world``, ...) read
their values from ``MC_CITY_*`` environment variables *at import time* and expose
them as module-level constants. The engine and pipeline modules bind those
constants at *their* import time too. This keeps stage code simple, but it means
a config change only takes effect after the affected modules are re-imported.

``configured_environment`` bridges that gap: it temporarily sets the requested
environment overrides, reloads every module in ``stages.RELOAD_ORDER`` (dependencies
before dependents, so rebound constants are consistent), yields, then restores the
previous environment and reloads once more to return the process to its baseline
configuration.

Because environment variables and imported modules are *process-global* state,
this mechanism is inherently single-writer:

- ``PIPELINE_LOCK`` serializes runs so two overridden pipelines never interleave.
- It does **not** make concurrent pipelines with *different* overrides safe --
  the lock guarantees one-at-a-time execution, not per-thread isolation. Callers
  must run overridden stages one at a time (as the GUI job queue does).

If per-call configuration isolation is ever needed, the durable fix is to thread
an explicit config object through the stages instead of reloading modules.
