# pipeline — stage orchestration

The pipeline drives [engine](../engine/README.md) and [config](../config/README.md)
through five numbered stages to produce the simulation previews, production
schematics, and a ready-to-play world. Each stage exposes a uniform
`run(*, logger=None, progress=None, ...)` entry so the GUI and CLI can call it the
same way.

← Back to the [source architecture overview](../README.md).

## Layout

| Module / package | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [services.py](services.py) | In-process pipeline services used by both the GUI and CLI |
| [stages.py](stages.py) | Central registry of stage modules plus the shared stage runner |
| [runtime.py](runtime.py) | `configured_environment` and the import-time config model helpers |
| `01_roads/` | `extract`, `simulation`, `render` |
| `02_builds/` | `extract`, `simulation`, `render` |
| `03_grid/` | `simulation`, `construct`, `render` |
| `04_city/` | `simulation`, `construct`, `render` |
| `05_world/` | `world` |

`extract` pulls assets from the world, `simulation` renders fast PNG previews,
`construct` builds production `.schem` output, `render` produces isometric PNGs,
and `world` exports the final city as a standalone Minecraft save.

## Runtime boundary

Pipeline stages read configuration from `MC_CITY_*` environment variables at
import time through the `config` package. In-process callers should not mutate
`os.environ` directly; call [`services.py`](services.py) functions with an
`env_overrides` dict containing only the `MC_CITY_*` values needed for that run.
[`runtime.py`](runtime.py) applies those values under a process-wide lock,
reloads config/engine/stage modules in dependency order, runs the stage, then
restores the previous environment and reloads again.

This keeps GUI runs deterministic, but it is still process-global state. Run
overridden stages one at a time inside a process. For true concurrent generation
with different configs, use separate processes or replace the import-time config
model with explicit config objects.

## Pipeline stages

**1. Roads.** [01_roads/extract.py](01_roads/extract.py) exports named road `.schem`
pieces from the `ROAD_BOX` region, plus fill props. [01_roads/simulation.py](01_roads/simulation.py)
draws the preview road PNGs.

**2. Builds.** [02_builds/extract.py](02_builds/extract.py) scans the `BUILD_TYPES`
regions, exports individual `.schem` pieces, and writes
`artifacts/builds/production/buildings.json` — the source of truth for placement.

**3. Grid.** [03_grid/simulation.py](03_grid/simulation.py) generates the road
network from a seed and composites the top-down preview;
[03_grid/construct.py](03_grid/construct.py) maps the same seed-driven network to
extracted road schematics and writes a production schematic grid. Both share the
same logical network (via [`engine.core.road_network`](../engine/README.md#how-the-road-grid-is-generated)),
rendered differently.

**4. City.** [04_city/simulation.py](04_city/simulation.py) renders the full city
preview; [04_city/construct.py](04_city/construct.py) assembles the final result —
loads/regenerates the road grid, loads the catalog, generates placements from the
seed, samples stack counts for three-piece buildings, assembles rotated building schematics, places
roads and buildings into one master 3D grid, optionally fills non-road ground
cells, and writes the Sponge `.schem` (with an offset so the schematic import
origin lands correctly).

**5. World.** [05_world/world.py](05_world/world.py) reads the final city `.schem`
and writes a standalone, ready-to-play world to `artifacts/saves/seed_<n>_world/`
(via [`engine.world.writer`](../engine/world/writer.py), the inverse of the Anvil
reader). It copies the selected source save, purges only the copied overworld
region files, writes generated city chunks back into that same layout, seats the
ground near y=64, centres the city on the world origin, and pins the player spawn
to solid ground so the world opens directly on the city.

## In-world asset conventions

Extraction is driven by explicit marker blocks, not guesswork.

### Roads & fill props

Roads are scanned inside `ROAD_BOX` with the shared marker extractor. A
one-layer asset becomes one road schematic, and the sign above the emerald
provides the exported name (e.g. `02_big_2x2_I`). Because markers define the
cuboid directly, a tile taller than `ROAD_BOX`'s Y span is still captured in full
(markers are searched over `BUILD_MARKER_Y_RANGE`).

Fill props are authored in the road region and named with a `fill` token
(`15_fill_1x1_A`, ...). Each is a self-contained 9x9 (one fine cell) asset
carrying its own ground. `engine.schematic.road` keeps them out of the road tile
set and exposes them via `load_fillers()`; `04_city/construct.py` drops a random,
randomly-rotated fill prop into every fully-empty non-road lot cell.

### Builds

Each build region in `BUILD_TYPES` carries a placement `type`. Builds are detected
from direct gold/diamond marker pairs: each gold is paired with the closest unused
diamond, and each pair defines one cuboid's opposite corners. Cuboids with the
same X/Z footprint are grouped by vertical alignment.

- **One layer** — one gold/diamond pair; exported as one complete schematic.

  ![Type 1 convention](../../docs/type1.png)

- **Three layers** — three vertically aligned gold/diamond pairs; exported as
  `bottom`/`middle`/`top` pieces. City generation can repeat the middle piece to
  vary height.

  ![Type 2 convention](../../docs/type2.png)

Type and layer count are independent: a type-1 building can have three layers,
and a type-2 landmark can have one. Type-2 catalog IDs are placed exactly once per
city; type-1 IDs have no repeat limit.

**Sign directives** inside a build footprint add catalog metadata: `stack: n` or
`stack: min-max` (how many middle sections a three-layer building can receive).

## Generated build catalog

`artifacts/builds/production/buildings.json` is written by stage 02 and consumed
by both simulation stand-ins and production placement. Each entry contains: `type`,
`size`, `origin`, `ground_offset`, and `pieces`, plus `stack` for three-layer
buildings.

## Simulation vs production

- **Simulation** — road PNGs and pseudo-build PNGs generated from catalog
  dimensions; fast iteration and layout validation.
- **Production** — extracted road and building schematics, the final combined city
  schematic, and the isometric render.

Placement logic is shared; only the rendered representation differs.

## Outputs

```text
artifacts/roads/production/*.schem
artifacts/builds/production/*.schem
artifacts/builds/production/buildings.json
artifacts/grid/production/seed_<n>.schem
artifacts/city/production/seed_<n>.schem
artifacts/saves/seed_<n>_world/                   # standalone playable world
artifacts/*/*/*.png                        # preview and render images
```

The final city schematic in `artifacts/city/production/` is a Sponge `.schem`;
`artifacts/saves/seed_<n>_world/` is a copied source-world save with generated
city regions, ready to drop straight into `.minecraft/saves/`.

## Running stages

From a repo checkout, direct script execution works without installing the
package:

```bash
python src/pipeline/01_roads/extract.py
python src/pipeline/02_builds/extract.py
python src/pipeline/03_grid/simulation.py --seed 5
python src/pipeline/03_grid/construct.py --seed 5
python src/pipeline/04_city/simulation.py --seed 5
python src/pipeline/04_city/construct.py --seed 5
python src/pipeline/04_city/render.py
python src/pipeline/05_world/world.py --seed 5
```

Package-module execution is also supported when `src/` is on `PYTHONPATH` or the
project is installed:

```bash
python -m pipeline.01_roads.extract
python -m pipeline.02_builds.extract
python -m pipeline.03_grid.simulation --seed 5
python -m pipeline.03_grid.construct --seed 5
python -m pipeline.04_city.simulation --seed 5
python -m pipeline.04_city.construct --seed 5
python -m pipeline.04_city.render
python -m pipeline.05_world.world --seed 5
```
