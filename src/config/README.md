# config — settings, tuning, paths & versioning

Configuration is the base layer of the source tree: it depends on nothing else in
`src/` and everything else depends on it. Values are read from `MC_CITY_*`
environment variables **at import time** and exposed as module-level constants, so
a stage's behavior is fixed once its config module is imported.

← Back to the [source architecture overview](../README.md).

## Modules

| Module | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [path.py](path.py) | Base layer: `env_*` typed override readers and runtime path/artifact discovery |
| [algo.py](algo.py) | Road-generation and city-placement tuning knobs |
| [world.py](world.py) | Source world path, extraction regions, marker Y range, schematic `DATA_VERSION` |
| [render.py](render.py) | Render and preview style constants (tile sizes, ground fill) |
| [models.py](models.py) | Typed domain models shared across stages (`BlockRegion`, `BuildRegion`) |
| [versions.py](versions.py) | DataVersion detection, release-name labels, and the hard floor |
| [doctor.py](doctor.py) | Environment diagnostics for first-run setup (`citygen-doctor`) |

Non-code assets that ship in this package:

- `default_world/` — the bundled source world (Minecraft 26.1.2)
  the app defaults to; `MC_CITY_SAVE` overrides it.
- `color_render.csv` — the isometric renderer's block-color palette (see
  [Render palette maintenance](#render-palette-maintenance)).

## The `MC_CITY_` override convention

Every tunable in `config` can be overridden by an `MC_CITY_<NAME>` environment
variable. The typed readers in `path.py` (`env_int`, `env_set`, `env_raw`, …)
apply the override or fall back to the default. The GUI and CLI set these
variables before importing/reloading a stage, which is how a run is configured
without editing code.

For in-process callers, the supported boundary is
`pipeline.services.<stage>(env_overrides={...})`. Pass only the `MC_CITY_*` keys
needed for that run; `pipeline.runtime.configured_environment` temporarily
applies them, reloads the import-time config graph, and restores the prior
environment after the stage exits.

## Version Compatibility

The pipeline copies block strings straight from the source world into the output
schematic, so block *content* is version-transparent. The one thing that is not
is the `DataVersion` stamped on the schematic: an older schematic can be upgraded
forward into a newer world, but a newer one cannot be downgraded safely.

CityGen commits to **forward-only** compatibility. The export target is always
the source world's own version or newer, so every block in the palette is
guaranteed to exist in the target. Forward upgrade is left to downstream import
or load tooling, and there is no downgrade or "missing block" computation.

Handled by [versions.py](versions.py):

- Outputs are **always stamped with the source world's `DataVersion`** (read from
  its `level.dat`, else the **26.1.2 hard floor**, and clamped up to that floor).
  Stamping any newer version would skip the DataFixer and hole out blocks renamed
  since the source (e.g. `grass` → `short_grass`).
- `DATA_VERSION` is pinned via `MC_CITY_DATA_VERSION` so construct/render stages —
  which do not set `MC_CITY_SAVE` — stamp the source version rather than
  re-detecting the default world.
- The floor is `HARD_FLOOR_DATA_VERSION = 4790` (Minecraft 26.1.2). Because every
  stamp is ≥ this floor, outputs always use the **Sponge v3** container; the
  writer and reader in [`engine/schematic`](../engine/README.md#schematic-io)
  are v3-only.
- `RELEASE_NAMES` maps DataVersions to release names for display. The Extraction
  tab shows the detected source version and a **Target Version** selector — an
  indicator of which versions the output can be pasted into (the source and
  newer), which does not change the stamp.

## Key configuration knobs

From [algo.py](algo.py):

- `CELL` — blocks/pixels per fine cell (9)
- `FINE` — grid edge in fine cells
- `DEFAULT_SEED` — default generation seed
- `GAP_BIG` / `GAP_SMALL` — spacing of big avenues (coarse grid) / small streets (fine grid)
- `GAP_MIXED` — minimum clearance between a small street and a big-road band
- `PAD_BIG` / `PAD_SMALL` — edge padding for big / small roads
- `N_BIG_CORNERS` / `N_BIG_TEES` — forced avenue L-corners / T-intersections
- `N_SMALL_CORNERS` / `N_SMALL_TEES` — forced street L-corners / T-intersections
- `BANNED_BUILDINGS` — building IDs excluded from placement
- `TYPE1_TOP_FIT_CHOICES` — standard-building variation depth
- `LANDMARK_SPACING` — minimum fine-cell distance between landmark footprints

From [world.py](world.py):

- `ROAD_BOX` — road extraction region
- `BUILD_TYPES` — build extraction regions (each with a `type`)
- `BUILD_MARKER_Y_RANGE` — Y range scanned for extraction markers
- `SAVE` — source Minecraft world

All of these accept `MC_CITY_`-prefixed overrides.

## Render palette maintenance

The isometric renderer loads block colors from `color_render.csv` (shipped in
this package). The generator that refreshes it is a repo-maintenance script, not
part of the runtime app:

```bash
python tools/update_render_colors.py
```

Notes:

- It downloads a Minecraft client JAR before regenerating the CSV; with
  `--version` omitted it resolves Mojang's latest release from the live manifest.
- Downloaded JARs land under `tools/` as `minecraft-client-<version>.jar` and are
  repo-local maintenance inputs — do not commit them.
- The script overwrites `color_render.csv`; rows use namespaced ids
  (`minecraft:stone`). Packaging includes only the CSV. Intended for infrequent
  manual updates when the target Minecraft version changes.
